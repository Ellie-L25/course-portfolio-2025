        <h1>My Dev Tools Vandalism - Apple.com</h1>
        <p>
            I used browser developer tools to temporarily "vandalize" the Apple.com
            website. Below is a screenshot showing my changes. These edits
            only appeared on my computer and did not affect the actual
            website.
        </p>
        <div class="screenshot-container">
            <!-- 
                IMPORTANT: Update the src attribute below to match your screenshot filename.
                Example: If your screenshot is named "apple-dot-com-but-with-papyrus-font.png", change the line to:
                src="./apple-dot-com-but-with-papyrus-font.png"
            -->
            <img src="./devtools-vandalism-screenshot.PNG" alt="Screenshot of the Apple webpage I vandalized" />
        </div>
        <h2>What I "Vandalized"</h2>
        <p>
            Below are some of the changes I made to the website using the browser's developer tools.
        <ul>
            <li>I edited the text heading for the main homepage as well as the paragraph text.</li>
            <li>The CSS properties I modified were the font color and heading background.</li>
            <li>I founded amusing to edit the text and just play around with the font color.</li>
            <li>I'm still trying to understand why some changes worked and some didn't and some of the restrictions.</li>
            <li>Chose the changes of on the heading because it was one of the first thing you see in the homepage and wanted to edit it.</li>
            <li>I can see the relation between HTML and CSS and how they work hand and hand to make the changes.</li>
            <li>I believe I have a better understanding of how dev tools can be utiized specially when I start working on my own webpages and styling it.</li>
        </ul>
